# cbmc-cpp-stdlib-tests
Simple test cases for verifying CBMC‚Äôs C and C++ standard library header support in C++ programs.

I created these during my thesis work to check the current state of CBMC's C++ support without much optimization.


‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
This is **not** a polished or comprehensive verification suite ‚Äî it‚Äôs a rudimentary setup, and GitHub Copilot generated some of the code.  
I experimented a bit with compiler flags for optimization, but there‚Äôs likely still room for improvement; it should be sufficient to show a trend.

All programs are tested as C++ programs using the .cpp extension.

Here are the results for CBMC 6.6.0 (with GCC 15.1.1 and Clang 20.1.6 used for sanity checks):


## üìå Import-Only Tests

In the corresponding test programs, the libraries are included but not used. For example:

```cpp 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {}

```

## üìå Import + Usage Tests

Simple test programs are provided for the imported libraries, but they do not cover the full range of functionality. For example: 

```cpp 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Test\n");
    return 0;
}

```
